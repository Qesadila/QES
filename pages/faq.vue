      <h2>The problem</h2>

      <p>
        Pandemic is <strong>chalenge for democracy</strong>. Maintain
        institutions nowaday means to
        <strong>protect elected representatives</strong> rights to participate
        on taking decisions. The city council meetings in many countries are
        (base on the law) personall, public and risky because of infection.
      </p>

      <p>
        For many citizens the
        <strong>municipalities are representing the democracy</strong> as
        closest institution. Many citizens participate on the public meetings to
        control representatives.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Without any change</strong> we can expect spread of the virus
        between elected representatives and citizens joining meetings of the
        municipalities. During the time there could be so many
        <strong>victims</strong>, that remaining persons will
        <strong>not fully represent</strong> the citizens (voters).
      </p>

      <p>
        People <strong>in the quarantine</strong>, staying
        <strong>at home</strong> caring for relatives, or
        <strong>in the hospital</strong> have limited possibilities
        <strong>to participate</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many <strong>countries are looking for the solution</strong>.
        Unfortunately some politicians already started to limit the competencies
        of the city councils, temporary
        <strong>switching off the national parliament</strong>, arguing by
        protecting the representatives.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another politicians without IT security knowledge allowed to
        <strong>use risky tools</strong> for making decisions. European
        parliament temporary use <strong>e-mail voting</strong>, cities in
        Slovakia started to use <strong>video calls</strong>, e-mails,
        <strong>signed papers</strong> as the voting evidences. If real time
        <strong>deep fake video</strong> are possible, e-mail can be changed,
        anyone can doubt such a decision so as institutions, or democracy.
      </p>

      <h2>The solution</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Qesadila alows secure online voting</strong>. Voter autorises
        each voting ballot by
        <strong>signature using eID based on PKCS#11</strong> worldwide standard
        (commonly issued by governments), or PGP certificate, which can anyone
        generate using the Qesadila for free.
      </p>

      <p>The solution consists of</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Qesadila web</strong> (to display voting results, manage Voter
          Lists and Voting Forms),
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Qesadila Auth</strong> desktop application (for authorisation
          of the user and his ballots. Windows, macOS, Linux supported)
        </li>
        <li><strong>Backend</strong> with logic, API, data storage.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        We have ambition to use Qesadila as an example of using modern
        technologies for governments.
      </p>

      <h2>What we did</h2>

      <p>
        We started to work on the solution only this month and this is our 3rd
        hackathon. During this hackathon we implemented: creation of the
        <strong>PGP certificate</strong> (for persons not using eID) in desktop
        application <strong>authorisation on the web</strong>* site by signing
        in desktop application using PGP certificate or eID improved workflows
        tooned GUI the solution is finaly localized to three languages and ready
        to easily add another languages.
      </p>

      <h2>Solution impact to the crisis</h2>

      <p>
        Using secure e-voting solutions like Qesadila will
        <strong>protect representatives</strong> from disease, allow
        <strong>to participate</strong> the representatives from quarantine,
        hospital, home allow to participate <strong>citizens</strong> from
        quarantine, hospital, home keep municipality / institution
        <strong>more representative</strong> and operational stop
        <strong>loosing</strong> necessery <strong>local leaders</strong> more
        people to participate, with <strong>longer time</strong> interval frame
        for voting <strong>strengthen democracy</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        The municipalities are active looking for the secure voting solution and
        we are receiving suggestion and requests to check the solution. We feel
        strong need of our solution.
      </p>

      <h2>After the crisis</h2>

      <p>
        To keep using secure e-voting solutions like Qesadila after the pandemic
        will
      </p>

      <p>
        keep us <strong>prepared for another crisis</strong> allows to
        <strong
          >participate from anywhere* - e.g. business trip and will take to more
          representative decissions promote **modern technologies</strong
        >
        do municipalities more <strong>effective and flexible</strong>
        <strong>save time</strong>, money, environment (with less transport
        to/from meetings, using less paper)
      </p>

      <h2>Necessities in order to continue</h2>

      <p>
        During this short month April 2020 we found out, that to develop
        <strong>proof of concept</strong> under the NGO Srdcom doma o.z.
        <strong>will not be enough</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are too many small cities and villages they doesn’t have IT
        cappacities to use our open source code and to build and run own system.
        To help them, means to provide the
        <strong>solution as cloud service</strong>, which means costs for cloud
        infrastructure, development, support.
      </p>

      <p>
        This can be done with <strong>viable success project</strong>. We are in
        a touch with local representatives in Slovakia, lawyers, having
        communication channells to members of the national parliament, which is
        necessary because every big change in the society influes the
        legislative.
      </p>

      <p>
        The new <strong>Slovak government</strong> supports electronic solutions
        and plans national electronic voting. We take this as so strong
        advantage, that we decided to use
        <strong>Slovakia and Cezch republic as pilot country</strong> for
        development.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have been contacted by IT companies representatives. We feel we have
        the good idea, which is <strong>needed by market</strong>. If is it so
        in a little bit conservative Slovakia, the need in other countries can
        be stronger.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beginning in May 2020 we plan to <strong>organize the pilot</strong> in
        few Slovak cities to get findings from real potential clients. This will
        take to prioritization of the possible features of the solutions,
        estabish cooperation with asociation of the cities and vilages in Slovak
        republic and Czech republic. add support od the Czech and Estonian eID
        and do roadmap of another countries ask for donation for start from
        non-commercial source, as we’d like to make the solution as cheap as
        possible for clients, create business and finantial plan in a
        cooperation with business consultants we met during hackathon,
        participate in programs supporting startups and inovations.
      </p>

      <h2>Business plan propositions</h2>

      <p>
        Problem worth solving maintain decision making offsite fullfill the
        national law with sharing information from municipalities to citizens
        Our solution e-voting system autorized with government issued eID, or
        PGP certificate public ballots with data to verify the voting process
        What’s unique focus on authorisation, certificates can be our strong
        specialistation, is defenetly strong side and can be almost unique with
        growing experiences in the time. It can take us to management of signed
        documents. Target market cities as a main type of client 141 cities in
